# Food-Detection-using-YOLO-v8
Object detection has become a widely used technique in various fields, including food recognition. In this report, we explore the use of YOLOv8 and Roboflow for object detection in food recognition. YOLOv8 is a state-ofthe-art object detection model that has achieved high accuracy in various benchmark datasets. Roboflow is a cloudbased platform for managing and augmenting training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of YOLOv8 and Roboflow in recognizing different types of food.
